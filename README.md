This is a homework for the TestNG

## TestNG assignment
1. Create Gradle project with TestNG support, use 'org.testng:testng:6.14.3'

2. Create a simple test with setup/teardown methods, each method should output its name in a console

3. Create a test class with several test groups
 * group dependency
 * group-specific setup/teardown methods
 * exclude one from test execution

4. Create a test class with 2 parameterized test methods
 * parameters from testng.xml
 * parameters from DataProvider

5. Create a class with 3 test methods that are executed from the bottom to the top of the class using priority

## Unit testing
There are number of different ways to run your unit tests, e.g.:
* In test class put your cursor on its definition, right click and choose `Run ...`
* Right click on a little green triangle near the class definition and choose `Run ...`
* In test class put your cursor on its definition and press `Ctrl+Shift+F10` (`Control+Shift+R`)
* Once you executed your test you could re-run it again by pressing `Shift+F10` (`Control+R`)
